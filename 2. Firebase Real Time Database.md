## Firebase Realtime Database 
### Write Operation

```js

<script>
  var name="Name";
  
  // Overwite the Data
  firebase.database().ref('data').set({name:name});
  
  // Append the Data and create unique key
  firebase.database().ref('data').push({name:name});
  
</script>

```

### Read Operation

```js

<script>
  var name="Name";

  firebase.database().ref('data').one('value',(snap)=>{
    console.log(snap.val());
  });

</script>

```

### Delete Operation

The simplest way to delete data is to call remove() on a reference to the location of that data.

You can also delete by specifying null as the value for another write operation such as set() or update(). You can use this technique with update() to delete multiple children in a single API call.
